This module will cover machine learning and Data Science

## Machine Learning
> It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
> 
> Machine learning (ML) is a field devoted to understanding and building methods that let machines "learn" – that is, methods that leverage data to improve computer performance on some set of tasks

> Machine learning model, algorithm, bot :receives and input and returns an output

## Types of Machine Learning
> ## Supervised Learning
>
> Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output Y = f(X)
> 
> Classification
>> It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.
> 
> Regression 
>>  A regression problem is when the output variable is a real or continuous value, such as “salary” or “weight”. Many different models can be used, the simplest is the linear regression. It tries to fit data with the best hyper-plane which goes through the points.
 
> ## Unsupervised Learning
> Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.
>
> Clustering
>> Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them.
>
> Association Rule Learning
>> A rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.

> ## Reinforced Learning
>> Skill Acquisition or Real time learning
>>
>> A machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.

### Steps in Machine Learning
> 1. Import the data 
> 2. Clean the data
> 3. Split data. Training Set/ Test Set
> 4. Create a Model
> 5. Check the output
> 6. Improve
