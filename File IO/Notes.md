# File IO

A file is a container in computer storage devices used for storing data.

When we want to read from or write to a file, we need to open it first. When we are done, it needs to be closed so that the resources that are tied with the file are freed.

Hence, in Python, a file operation takes place in the following order:

1. Open a file
1. Read or write (perform operation)
1. Close the file
